CS121 Project - GroupGoal Application

GroupGoal is an Android application developed by Noam Hurwitz (nhurwitz), Vicky Gyorffy (vickygyorffy),
Reece Denzel (rdenzel), and Joanna Finkelstein (jff0202012) for the CS121 Software Development group project. 

The concept of the app is to allow you to make goal events, and invite friends to them. You can also browse local goals
and join ones that interest you. A GroupGoal is something that you cannot or prefer not to accomplish individually,
and can range from a study session to ordering a pizza.
